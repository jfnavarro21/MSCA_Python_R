This assignment helps understanding linear models for time series

## 1. Exercise 2 on page 125

Use the file m-dec125910-6111.txt
```{r}
# read in data
datapath <- "C:/Users/JohntheGreat/Documents/MSCA/FinancialAnalytics/Week3_TimeSeries"
da=read.table(paste(datapath,"m-dec125910-6111.txt",sep="/"),header=T)
head(da)
dim(da)
```


### For CRSP portfolios of Decile 2, 10 returns test null hypothesis that the first 12 lags of autocorrelations equal zero with 5% level

```{r}

```


### Fit ARMA model for returns of Decile 2, perform model checking and write down the fitted model

```{r}

```


### Use the fitted model to produce 1- to 12-step ahead forecasts of the series and the associated standard errors of forecasts.

```{r}

```
